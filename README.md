# estrelabet-teste
Crawler developed as a test for Estrela Bet
==================================================================

## Description

Crawler to search the following information on the EstrelaBet website (estrelabet.com). What will be Cruzeiro's next game (opposing team, day and time)? and what are the Odds of this game (victory, draw and defeat)? The crawler must be done with Python or JavaScript, according to your choice.

The crawler was made with JavaScript.

## Libraries

Currently, we are using two Libraries, are they:
"axios version ^0.14.0" :
Promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser.

"puppeteer version ^20.7.4":
Puppeteer is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome/Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.

## Observation

It is better to run the axios_v version, to run it, use "node .\axios_v.js".

The pptr version (the index.js version) is not stable, since most of the time the website was not responding. Because of this problem, it was not possible to run tests on the code.
